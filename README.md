Machine Learning Algorithm Application
Overview
This project aims to create an application that simplifies the process of machine learning experiments for users without Python knowledge. The application allows users to perform data science tasks through a drag-and-drop interface, define process flows, configure hyperparameters, and access various machine learning algorithms. The initial prototype includes a feature that splits datasets into training, testing, and validation sets.

Features
Drag-and-Drop Interface: Users can visually build their machine learning workflows by dragging and dropping components.
Dataset Splitting: Automatically splits datasets into training, testing, and validation sets with customizable ratios.
Hyperparameter Configuration: Users can easily define and adjust hyperparameters for machine learning algorithms.
Algorithm Access: Users can choose from various pre-configured machine learning algorithms for their experiments.
Customizable Graphs: Visualize results and experiment performance with customizable graphs.
